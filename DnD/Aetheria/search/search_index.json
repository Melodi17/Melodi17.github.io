Aetheria is a place where clockwork marvels coexist with ancient spells, and airships traverse the skies as knights don enchanted armor to face mythical creatures.</p> <p>Aetheria is a world on the brink of transformation. The discovery of Aether, a mystical, elemental energy source, has fueled an industrial revolution that has given rise to magnificent cities, towering steam-driven constructs, and arcane wonders. As the power of Aether grows, so does the struggle for control over its source. Factions and guilds vie for supremacy, each seeking to harness Aether for their own ends.</p> <p>The Guild of Artificers, with their clockwork creations, seeks to expand their mechanical dominion. The Aetheric Order, an ancient cabal of spellcasters, strives to preserve the sanctity of magic in a world driven by machinery. The Explorer's League scours uncharted lands for forgotten relics, while the Ironclad Alliance battles to maintain order in a world filled with untamed wonders.</p> <p>Amidst this backdrop of conflict and innovation, adventurers emerge. Heroes who dare to explore the uncharted realms, confront mythical beasts, and unravel the mysteries of Aetheria. As they navigate through the city-states and uncharted territories, they face moral dilemmas about the use of Aether, forge alliances with enigmatic creatures and races, and strive to find a balance between magic and machinery.</p> <p>In \"Aetheria: The Age of Steam and Sorcery,\" players take on the roles of these heroes, choosing to align with guilds, factions, or chart their own path. Their choices will shape the destiny of Aetheria, as they uncover the secrets of Aether, defend against the rise of dark forces, and steer the world toward a new era of progress and enchantment.</p> <p>The future of Aetheria hangs in the balance, and the heroes of this age must decide whether to embrace the power of Aether, preserve the ancient ways of magic, or forge a new destiny where the two can coexist harmoniously.</p>"},{"location":"Items/Coin%20Pouch/","title":"Coin Pouch","text":""},{"location":"Items/Coin%20Pouch/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>This can hold an unlimited amount of anything that is \"deemed\" currency</p>"},{"location":"Items/Coin%20Pouch/#deemed-currency","title":"Deemed currency","text":"<p>This is controlled by the DM</p>"},{"location":"Items/Synced%20Book/","title":"Synced Book","text":"<p>Multiple people will have the same book, they will have synced content, mostly quests and requests.</p>"},{"location":"NPCs/Dralnir/","title":"Dralnir","text":"<p>Nothing here</p>"},{"location":"Places/Stone-walled%20Building/","title":"Stone-walled Building","text":""},{"location":"Places/Stone-walled%20Building/#known-monsters","title":"Known Monsters","text":"<ul> <li>Human guards<ul> <li>Chainmail armor</li> <li>Longsword</li> </ul> </li> <li>Orcs</li> <li>Goblins</li> <li>Hob-Goblins</li> <li>Mimics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Places/Stone-walled%20Building/#notations","title":"Notations","text":"<ul> <li>Hidden room behind bookcase</li> <li>Unknown depth hole, filled with bodies disposed during parties visit Session 1 -
